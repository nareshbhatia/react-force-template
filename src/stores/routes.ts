// Routes are matched from top to bottom. Make sure they are sequenced
// in the order of priority. It is generally best to sort them by pattern,
// prioritizing specific patterns over generic patterns (patterns with
// one or more parameters). For example:
//     /items
//     /items/:id
export const routes = [
    { name: 'home', pattern: '/' },
    {
        name: 'examples',
        pattern: '/examples/:navItemId',
    },
    { name: 'notFound', pattern: '/not-found' },
